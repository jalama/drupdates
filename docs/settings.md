Settings
===========

To make this script meet your needs you will need to customize the settings,
loaded from YAML files.  As of version 1.0 there is no installer so the settings
are changed and updated by either using a YAML file or passing options at
runtime.

At see http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation for YAML basics.

Here's how it works:

Settings are built from either YAML files or options passed when run on CLI.

-  Settings are loaded in this order:<a name="overrides"></a>
    -  Core settings file, ie drupdates/settings/default.yaml
    -  [Plugin](plugins.md) settings files, ie *plugin dir*/settings/default.yaml
    -  Local settings file in $HOME/.drupdates, ie $HOME/.drupdates/settings.yaml
    -  Options passed at runtime, ie $python -m drupdates --workingDir=/opt/
    -  Prompts to end user, only if required and not value found above

Settings loaded later take precident over the same setting loaded earlier,
ie if it's set at runtime it will overwrite anything set in the Core settings
or local settings files.

The Core settings file is [/drupdates/settings/default.yaml](https://github.com/jalama/drupdates/blob/master/drupdates/settings default.yaml). Additionally, each plugin ships with it's own default.yaml file in its respective settings directory.

Custom Settings file:

You will need to overwirte settings file upon set-up.  To do this create a local
settings file in $HOME/.drupdates/settings.yaml.  Sample settings files can be
found below.

Settings Format:

Each setting in the YAML file needs to be a dictionary with the following keys.
Each setting should formatted like below or it will be assumed to be blank
(ie "") there are notes on what each line means for clarities sake. Note: Python
interprets "" as False.

```
setting: the name of the setting
  value: required, value of the setting1
```
Optionally each setting can have other attributes (@see Settings.model()):
```
setting:
  value:
  prompt: optional, Prompt presented at runtime if setting is null and required
  format: optional, What is the format, supported values: string (default), list, dict
  required: optional, Is the setting required2
  requires: optional, does this setting require another setting
```
1 Surround with '' if value contains special cahracters.  For list of YAML
special characters @see http://www.yaml.org/refcard.html.

2 If setting is required and is empty, the end user will be asked for a value.
